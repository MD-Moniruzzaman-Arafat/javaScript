// What is a Compiler?
// A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code into machine code (binary code) all at once before running it.

// How it works:
// Reads the whole code at once.
// Checks for errors in the code.
// Converts the code into an executable file (.exe) that can run without the source code.


// What is an Interpreter?
// An interpreter translates and executes the code line by line instead of compiling the entire code at once.

// How it works:
// Reads one line of code.
// Translates it into machine code.
// Executes the translated code immediately.
// Stops if it encounters an error, reports it, and doesn't proceed further.


// What is JIT Compilation?
// JIT Compilation means that JavaScript code is compiled into machine code at runtime, instead of being precompiled (like C/C++) or purely interpreted (line-by-line).

// It acts as a middle ground between interpretation and compilation.
// JIT compilers dynamically optimize code during execution, improving performance significantly.
